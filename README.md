# Challenge-3

## Description
Challenge 3 coursework for UT bootcamp.
I am to create a password generator for this challenge,
in which the password must meet the criteria of:
-Having 8 - 128 characters in length.
-Having AT LEAST one of: symbols, numbers, lowercase, or uppercase letters. 
Comments are added through the script.js file for readability.

## Screenshots
--The screen as seen (I did not design, it came with the .html)--

## What I Have Learned
I have learned how versatile JavaScript can be with this password generator project.
Utilizing alerts, confirms, and prompts were a must, as well as 
if/else statements in order to allow the user to make choices for their password,
but under a couple guidelines.

## Credits
Made by Allie Stewart.
Google helped a ton for alert/confirm/prompt, 
but so did class notes in regards to if/else usage.
